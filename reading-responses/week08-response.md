# Week 8 Reading Response: Network Analysis

**Name**: [Your Name]  
**Date**: [Submission Date]  
**Week**: 8 (March 10-14, 2026)

## Required Readings

Review the required readings listed in your Week 8 assignment on Brightspace. Include full citations for any readings you reference in your response.

## Part 1: Technical Reflection (150-250 words)

**Reflect on this week's technical work:**

This week you created network visualizations and analyzed relational data—representing connections between historical actors, places, or concepts.

- What decisions did you make about defining nodes and edges?
- What was challenging about translating complex relationships into network data?
- What patterns emerged from network metrics or visualizations?
- How did you interpret the quantitative measures of network structure?

### Your Technical Reflection

[Write 150-250 words reflecting on the technical/computational aspects of this week...]

## Part 2: Reading Response (400-500 words)

This week's readings explore network analysis and relational approaches to history.

**Choose ONE of the following prompts:**

1. **Relational Approaches**: Engage with how the readings conceptualize network analysis as a historical method. What do the authors suggest is gained by focusing on relationships rather than individual actors or events? What kinds of historical questions are well-suited to network approaches? What are the limitations they identify?

2. **Formalization and Abstraction**: The readings discuss the process of transforming historical relationships into network data (nodes and edges). What do the authors say about the interpretive work involved in this formalization? What complexities get simplified or lost? How should historians balance formalization with nuance?

3. **Network Metrics as Historical Evidence**: Reflect on what the readings suggest about interpreting network measurements (centrality, betweenness, clustering, etc.). What can these metrics tell historians? What do the authors say about the limits of quantitative measures? How should computational findings relate to historical interpretation?
