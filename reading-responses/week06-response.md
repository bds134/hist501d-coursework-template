**Date**: [Submission Date]  
**Week**: 6 (February 24-28, 2026)

## Required Readings

Review the required readings listed in your Week 6 assignment on Brightspace. Include full citations for any readings you reference in your response.

## Part 1: Technical Reflection (150-250 words)

**Reflect on this week's technical work:**

This week you collected data programmatically using APIs and web scraping—accessing digital collections and citation databases.

- What data sources did you access? What was the experience of programmatic data collection like?
- What challenges did you encounter with APIs or web scraping?
- How did collecting data computationally differ from manual research?
- What ethical considerations came up when accessing data programmatically?

## Part 2: Reading Response (400-500 words)

This week's readings explore data collection, digital archives, and access to online resources.

**Choose ONE of the following prompts:**

1. **Digital Archives and Discovery**: The readings discuss how digitization and programmatic access are changing historical research. What do the authors suggest about how APIs and digital archives transform source discovery and selection? What becomes more visible or accessible? What remains hidden or marginalized in digital collections?

2. **Computational Approaches to Scholarship**: Reflect on what the readings say about using computational methods for literature review or bibliographic analysis. What possibilities do citation networks, APIs, and programmatic bibliography offer? How might these methods complement or change traditional approaches to mapping historiography?

3. **Ethics of Access**: Consider what the readings suggest about ethical issues in data collection. What responsibilities do researchers have when scraping websites or using APIs? How should historians think about terms of service, copyright, data ownership, and equitable access to digital resources?
