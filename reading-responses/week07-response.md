# Week 7 Reading Response: Spatial History & Mapping

**Name**: [Your Name]  
**Date**: [Submission Date]  
**Week**: 7 (March 3-7, 2026)

## Required Readings

Review the required readings listed in your Week 7 assignment on Brightspace. Include full citations for any readings you reference in your response.

## Part 1: Technical Reflection (150-250 words)

**Reflect on this week's technical work:**

This week you created digital maps and performed spatial analysis—representing historical data geographically.

- What decisions did you make about what to map and how to represent it?
- What challenges did you encounter with geocoding, projections, or spatial data?
- Did mapping reveal spatial patterns you hadn't recognized before?
- What was difficult about representing historical phenomena spatially?

### Your Technical Reflection

## Part 2: Reading Response (400-500 words)

This week's readings explore spatial history, mapping, and geographic approaches to the past.

**Choose ONE of the following prompts:**

1. **Theorizing Spatial History**: Engage with how the readings conceptualize the "spatial turn" in history. What do the authors suggest spatial analysis contributes to historical understanding? What becomes visible when historians foreground geography and space? What are the theoretical or methodological limitations they identify?

2. **Cartographic Rhetoric**: The readings discuss maps as rhetorical and argumentative forms. How do the authors characterize the persuasive work that maps perform? What choices do mapmakers make that shape interpretation? What are the politics of cartographic representation? How can historians use maps responsibly and effectively?

3. **Historical GIS Challenges**: Reflect on what the readings say about adapting GIS tools for historical research. What challenges do historians face with changing boundaries, uncertain locations, incomplete data, or representing change over time? How do the authors suggest historians should approach these methodological problems?
