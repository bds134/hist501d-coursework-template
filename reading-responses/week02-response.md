# Week 2 Reading Response: Python Fundamentals & DH Tools

**Name**: [Your Name]  
**Date**: [Submission Date]  
**Week**: 2 (January 27-31, 2026)

## Required Readings

Review the required readings listed in your Week 2 assignment on Brightspace. Include full citations for any readings you reference in your response.

## Part 1: Technical Reflection (150-250 words)

**Reflect on this week's technical work:**

This week you learned Python fundamentals and set up your digital history toolkit (Python, Git, VSCode, citation managers). 

- What aspects of learning Python felt intuitive or challenging?
- How does learning a programming language compare to other research methods in your training?
- What potential do you see for computational tools in your own research?
- Any surprises or "aha" moments with the technology?

### Your Technical Reflection

[Write 150-250 words reflecting on the technical/computational aspects of this week...]

## Part 2: Reading Response (400-500 words)

This week's readings discuss essential tools and methodologies for digital history work.

**Choose ONE of the following prompts:**

1. **Digital History Tools and Practice**: How do the readings conceptualize the role of digital tools in historical research? What do they suggest about the relationship between tools and methodology? Do tools simply make existing work more efficient, or do they enable fundamentally different kinds of historical questions?

2. **Citation Management and Scholarship**: The readings discuss systematic approaches to managing sources and citations. Beyond organization, what intellectual work does citation management perform? How might programmatic access to citation data (APIs, databases) transform literature review practices or historiographic analysis?

3. **Learning Digital Methods**: Reflect on what the readings suggest about learning digital/computational methods as a historian. What disciplinary knowledge do historians bring to computational work? How does technical skill relate to historical interpretation?
