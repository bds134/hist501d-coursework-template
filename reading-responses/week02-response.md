## Part 1: Technical Reflection (150-250 words)

**Reflect on this week's technical work:**

The exercises this last week focused on Markdown and Bash. We also learned some git, github and vscode. You also installed a lot of new software! That's a lot.

- What aspects of learning Markdown felt intuitive or challenging?
- Can you see the utility of Markdown in your scholarly development?
- Were there any surprises or "aha" moments?

### Your Technical Reflection

[Write 150-250 words reflecting on the technical/computational aspects of this week...]

## Part 2: Reading Response (400-500 words)

This week's readings explore computational thinking, essential web code (HTML, CSS, and Javascript), learning to code as a humanist (and taking a moment to reflect upon that), and using AI responsibly in historical research.

**Write about what matters most to you from these readings.** What struck you? What challenged your thinking? What connections do you see to your own research or intellectual interests? What questions do the readings raise for you?

You might consider themes like: the relationship between computational methods and historical imagination, what it means to "learn to code" as a historian in 2026, the opportunities and risks of AI in historical research, or how digital methods relate to traditional historiographic practices. But follow your own intellectual interests—these are starting points, not requirements.
