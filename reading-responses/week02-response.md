## Part 1: Technical Reflection (150-250 words)

**Reflect on this week's technical work:**

This week you learned Python fundamentals—variables, data types, control flow, functions—and worked through the Programming Historian text files tutorial.

- What aspects of learning Python felt intuitive or challenging?
- How does learning to code (with or without AI assistance) differ from what Ramsay describes?
- What potential do you see for Python in your own historical research?
- Any surprises or "aha" moments with programming?

### Your Technical Reflection

[Write 150-250 words reflecting on the technical/computational aspects of this week...]

## Part 2: Reading Response (400-500 words)

This week's readings explore computational thinking, learning to code as a humanist, and using AI responsibly in historical research.

**Write about what matters most to you from these readings.** What struck you? What challenged your thinking? What connections do you see to your own research or intellectual interests? What questions do the readings raise for you?

You might consider themes like: the relationship between computational methods and historical imagination, what it means to "learn to code" as a historian in 2026, the opportunities and risks of AI in historical research, or how digital methods relate to traditional historiographic practices. But follow your own intellectual interests—these are starting points, not requirements.

## AI Use Documentation

**Did you use AI assistance (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) for this assignment?**

[ ] Yes  
[ ] No

**If yes, describe how:**

[Explain what AI tools you used and for what purposes. Examples: brainstorming ideas, editing grammar, checking citations, etc. Be specific.]

**Reflection on AI use:**

[Brief reflection: Was the AI helpful? Did it change your writing process? Any limitations you noticed?]
