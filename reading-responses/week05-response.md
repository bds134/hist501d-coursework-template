# Week 5 Reading Response: Text Analysis & Python

**Name**: [Your Name]  
**Date**: [Submission Date]  
**Week**: 5 (February 17-21, 2026)

## Required Readings

Review the required readings listed in your Week 5 assignment on Brightspace. Include full citations for any readings you reference in your response.

## Part 1: Technical Reflection (150-250 words)

**Reflect on this week's technical work:**

This week you performed computational text analysis—analyzing patterns across texts at scale.

- What patterns or insights emerged from computational analysis that you might not have noticed through close reading?
- What challenges did you encounter moving from text to numbers (word counts, frequencies, etc.)?
- How did you interpret the quantitative outputs? What historical knowledge did you bring to that interpretation?
- What felt lost or gained in computational text analysis compared to traditional reading?

### Your Technical Reflection

[Write 150-250 words reflecting on the technical/computational aspects of this week...]

## Part 2: Reading Response (400-500 words)

This week's readings explore computational approaches to analyzing texts.

**Choose ONE of the following prompts:**

1. **Distant Reading Debates**: Engage with arguments about "distant reading" in the readings. What do the authors see as the promise and limitations of reading computationally at scale? How do they characterize the relationship between distant and close reading? Are these complementary methods or fundamentally different approaches? What's at stake in these debates?

2. **Scale and Historical Analysis**: Reflect on what the readings say about analyzing large textual corpora. What becomes visible at scale that isn't apparent in close reading? What historical questions are best suited to computational text analysis? What are the methodological or interpretive risks?

3. **From Computation to Interpretation**: The readings discuss moving from computational outputs (word frequencies, topic models, etc.) to historical arguments. What do the authors suggest about this interpretive process? What makes computational text analysis distinctively historical work rather than just data science? What expertise must historians bring?
