# Week 4 Reading Response: Data Visualization

**Name**: [Your Name]  
**Date**: [Submission Date]  
**Week**: 4 (February 10-14, 2026)

## Required Readings

Review the required readings listed in your Week 4 assignment on Brightspace. Include full citations for any readings you reference in your response.

## Part 1: Technical Reflection (150-250 words)

**Reflect on this week's technical work:**

This week you created data visualizations using matplotlib and other tools—translating datasets into visual forms.

- What decisions did you make about chart types, colors, scales, and labels?
- How did your visualization choices affect what patterns became visible or emphasized?
- What challenges did you face moving from data to visual representation?
- Did any visualizations reveal patterns you hadn't noticed in the raw data?

### Your Technical Reflection

[Write 150-250 words reflecting on the technical/computational aspects of this week...]

## Part 2: Reading Response (400-500 words)

This week's readings explore visualization as a mode of historical argument and analysis.

**Choose ONE of the following prompts:**

1. **Visualization as Rhetoric**: The readings discuss how visualizations make arguments through design choices. How do the authors characterize the rhetorical work that visualizations perform? What makes a visualization persuasive or misleading? How should historians think about the relationship between visual and textual argumentation?

2. **Design Ethics and Interpretation**: Reflect on what the readings say about how design decisions (chart type, scale, color, etc.) shape interpretation. What responsibilities do historians have when creating visualizations? How should concerns about accessibility, clarity, and potential misinterpretation guide design choices?

3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Consider what the readings suggest about visualization as a tool for discovery versus communication. How do visualizations function in the research process? What role might exploratory visualization play in historical analysis? How does this relate to traditional historical methods?
