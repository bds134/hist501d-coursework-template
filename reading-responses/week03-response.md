# Week 3 Reading Response: Data Cleaning & Pandas

**Name**: [Your Name]  
**Date**: [Submission Date]  
**Week**: 3 (February 3-7, 2026)

## Required Readings

Review the required readings listed in your Week 3 assignment on Brightspace. Include full citations for any readings you reference in your response.

## Part 1: Technical Reflection (150-250 words)

**Reflect on this week's technical work:**

This week you learned data cleaning and manipulation with pandas—transforming messy historical sources into structured datasets.

- What challenges did you encounter cleaning and structuring data?
- How did you make decisions about handling missing values, standardizing formats, or structuring information?
- What surprised you about the amount of interpretive work involved in "cleaning" data?
- How might these skills apply to your own research?

### Your Technical Reflection

[Write 150-250 words reflecting on the technical/computational aspects of this week...]

## Part 2: Reading Response (400-500 words)

This week's readings explore data practices in digital history and humanities.

**Choose ONE of the following prompts:**

1. **Data as Historical Source**: The readings discuss how historical data is created, not simply found. How do the authors characterize the relationship between sources and data? What interpretive choices are embedded in the process of transforming historical materials into structured datasets? What does it mean to treat data itself as a historical artifact?

2. **The Politics of Data**: Reflect on what the readings say about power, representation, and bias in datasets. How might choices in data collection, categorization, and structuring reinforce or challenge existing historical narratives? What responsibilities do historians have when creating or working with datasets?

3. **Computational Affordances**: Consider what the readings suggest becomes possible (or impossible) when historical sources are transformed into structured data. What kinds of patterns or insights emerge at scale? What is lost in the transformation from rich sources to structured data? How should historians balance distant and close reading?
