## Instructions

Document all AI assistance you used while completing this week's assignment. Be specific and honest.

## AI Tools Used

**Tool 1**: [e.g., GitHub Copilot]
- **Task**: [What were you trying to do?]
- **How it helped**: [What suggestions did it provide?]
- **What you learned**: [Did this help you understand the code better?]

**Tool 2**: [e.g., ChatGPT]
- **Task**: [What question did you ask?]
- **How it helped**: [What was the response?]
- **What you learned**: [How did you apply this to your work?]

## Reflection

- Did AI assistance speed up your work or slow you down?
- Did you understand the code that AI suggested?
- When did you choose to code manually vs. use AI?
