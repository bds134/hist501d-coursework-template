# Week 3: Data Cleaning with Pandas

**Due**: Monday, February 9 at 9:00 AM

## Assignment Overview

Clean and analyze a messy historical dataset using pandas:
- Load and explore data
- Identify quality issues (missing values, inconsistencies, duplicates)
- Clean and standardize the dataset
- Document your decisions

## Files

- `data-cleaning.ipynb` - Complete this Jupyter notebook
- `dataset.csv` - The messy data (provided via Brightspace)
- `AI-use-log.md` - Document AI assistance

## Tasks

1. Load the dataset and examine its structure
2. Identify and document data quality issues
3. Clean the data (handle missing values, standardize formats, remove duplicates)
4. Create summary statistics before/after cleaning
5. Write about what was lost/transformed in the cleaning process

## Key Questions

- What counts as "clean" data for historical research?
- What information is lost when you standardize?
- How do your cleaning choices affect interpretation?

## Deliverables

- Completed Jupyter notebook with:
  - Code for all cleaning steps
  - Markdown cells explaining decisions
  - Visualizations showing before/after
  - Critical reflection on cleaning choices
- AI use log

## Grading Criteria

- Data cleaning effectiveness (30%)
- Documentation of decisions (25%)
- Critical reflection (25%)
- Code quality and organization (20%)
