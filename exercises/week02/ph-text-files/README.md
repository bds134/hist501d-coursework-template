# Programming Historian: Working with Text Files

This folder is for your Programming Historian tutorial exercise ("Working with Text Files in Python").

## Instructions

Follow the [Working with Text Files in Python](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/working-with-text-files) tutorial and create the following files in this folder:

### Files to Create

1. **file-output.py** - Script that writes "hello world" to a text file
2. **file-input.py** - Script that reads from a text file and prints the contents
3. **file-append.py** - Script that appends text to an existing file
4. **helloworld.txt** - The text file created and modified by your scripts

## What You'll Learn

- How to create and write to text files with Python
- How to read from text files
- How to append content to existing files
- Understanding file modes (`'w'`, `'r'`, `'a'`)

## Tips

- Follow the tutorial step by step
- Test each script as you create it
- The `helloworld.txt` file will be created by your `file-output.py` script
- After running `file-append.py` multiple times, `helloworld.txt` will contain multiple "hello world" lines

## Submission

Complete all 4 files and commit/push your work by the deadline.

**Tip:** Commit and push frequently as you work! It's good version control practice and protects your work. You don't need to wait until everything is perfect—commit after completing each script.
