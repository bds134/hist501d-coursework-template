# Programming Historian: Working with Text Files

This folder is for your Programming Historian tutorial exercise ("Working with Text Files in Python").

## Instructions

Follow the [Working with Text Files in Python](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/working-with-text-files) tutorial and create the following files in this folder:

### Files to Create

As you work through the tutorial, you'll create these files:

1. **obo.py** - A Python module containing reusable functions for text manipulation
2. **trial-content.py** - Script that uses functions from the obo module to fetch and clean web content
3. **write-html.py** - Script that wraps text in HTML tags and writes to a file
4. **output.txt** - Text file created by your scripts (or similar output files)

## What You'll Learn

- How to create Python modules with reusable functions
- How to import and use functions from your own modules
- How to read from and write to text files
- How to manipulate strings (strip HTML tags, wrap in HTML)
- Understanding file modes (`'w'`, `'r'`, `'a'`)
- Basic web scraping with urllib

## Tips

- Follow the tutorial step by step - the order matters
- Test each function in `obo.py` as you create it
- The tutorial teaches you to build a reusable module that you'll import in other scripts
- Don't worry if you don't understand everything immediately - we'll use these concepts again in later weeks
- You can use GitHub Copilot to help, but make sure you understand what each function does

## Submission

Complete all required files and commit/push your work by the deadline.

**Tip:** Commit and push frequently as you work! It's good version control practice and protects your work. You don't need to wait until everything is perfect—commit after completing each script.
