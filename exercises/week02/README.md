# Week 2: Python Fundamentals & AI-Assisted Coding

**Due**: Monday, February 9 at 9:00 AM

## Assignment Overview

This week has two parts:
1. **Python Fundamentals Notebook** - Core exercises covering variables, control flow, lists, dictionaries
2. **Programming Historian Tutorial** - Working with text files in Python

Complete Python fundamentals exercises covering:
- Variables and data types
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions
- Lists and dictionaries
- Basic file I/O

## Files to Complete

### Part 1: Python Fundamentals Jupyter Notebook
- `python-fundamentals/python-fundamentals.ipynb` - 10 exercises + optional challenges

### Part 2: Programming Historian Tutorial
Complete the [Working with Text Files in Python](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/working-with-text-files) tutorial and create:
- `ph-text-files/obo.py` - Module with reusable functions
- `ph-text-files/trial-content.py` - Script using the obo module
- `ph-text-files/write-html.py` - Script to generate HTML from text
- `ph-text-files/output.txt` - Output file created by your scripts

### Documentation
- `AI-use-log.md` - Document any AI assistance (required)

## Instructions

### Part 1: Python Fundamentals Notebook

1. Navigate to `python-fundamentals/` folder
2. Open `python-fundamentals.ipynb` in VSCode
3. Complete all exercises in the Jupyter notebook
4. Test your code to ensure it runs without errors
5. Add markdown cells explaining your approach

### Part 2: Programming Historian Tutorial

1. Read through [Working with Text Files in Python](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/working-with-text-files)
2. Follow along and create the required Python scripts in `ph-text-files/` folder:
   - `obo.py` - module with reusable functions
   - `trial-content.py` - script using the obo module  
   - `write-html.py` - script to generate HTML
   - `output.txt` - text output file
3. See the README in `ph-text-files/` folder for detailed instructions
4. Run each script and verify it works as expected

### Final Steps

1. Document AI use in `AI-use-log.md`
2. Commit and push all your work before the deadline

### Git Best Practices

**Commit early and often!** Don't save all your commits for the end.

- Commit after completing each exercise or script
- Write clear commit messages (e.g., "Completed exercise 5", "Fixed loop in file-append.py")
- Push to GitHub regularly to back up your work
- Multiple commits are encouraged—they show your process and protect against data loss
- You don't need to wait until everything is perfect to commit

## AI Use Requirements

**You MUST document**:
- Which AI tools you used (Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)
- What specific tasks you used them for
- How the AI helped (or didn't help)

See `AI-use-log.md` for the template.

## Getting Help

- Office hours: Mondays 3:15-4:45pm, Tuesdays 9:30-11am
