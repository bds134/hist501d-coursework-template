# Week 2: Python Fundamentals & AI-Assisted Coding

**Due**: Monday, February 2 at 9:00 AM

## Assignment Overview

Complete Python fundamentals exercises covering:
- Variables and data types
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions
- Lists and dictionaries
- Basic file I/O

This week has two parts: a Jupyter notebook with exercises AND a Programming Historian tutorial.

## Files to Complete

### Part 1: Python Fundamentals
- `python-fundamentals/python-fundamentals.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with core exercises

### Part 2: Programming Historian Tutorial
- `ph-text-files/file-output.py` - script to write to text files
- `ph-text-files/file-input.py` - script to read from text files
- `ph-text-files/file-append.py` - script to append to text files
- `ph-text-files/helloworld.txt` - the text file you create and modify

### Documentation
- `AI-use-log.md` - Document any AI assistance

## Instructions

### Part 1: Python Fundamentals Notebook

1. Navigate to `python-fundamentals/` folder
2. Open `python-fundamentals.ipynb` in VSCode
3. Complete all exercises in the Jupyter notebook
4. Test your code to ensure it runs without errors
5. Add markdown cells explaining your approach

### Part 2: Programming Historian Tutorial

1. Read through [Working with Text Files in Python](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/working-with-text-files)
2. Create the three Python scripts in the `ph-text-files/` folder as you follow along
3. Run each script and verify it works as expected
4. Keep the `helloworld.txt` file that gets created

### Final Steps

1. Document AI use in `AI-use-log.md`
2. Commit and push all your work before the deadline

### Git Best Practices

**Commit early and often!** Don't save all your commits for the end.

- Commit after completing each exercise or script
- Write clear commit messages (e.g., "Completed exercise 5", "Fixed loop in file-append.py")
- Push to GitHub regularly to back up your work
- Multiple commits are encouraged—they show your process and protect against data loss
- You don't need to wait until everything is perfect to commit

## AI Use Requirements

**You MUST document**:
- Which AI tools you used (Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.)
- What specific tasks you used them for
- How the AI helped (or didn't help)

See `AI-use-log.md` for the template.
