# Week 5: Text Analysis with Python

**Due**: Monday, February 23 at 9:00 AM

## Assignment Overview

Analyze a historical text corpus using multiple NLP techniques.

## Files

- `text-analysis.ipynb` - Complete this notebook
- `corpus/` - Folder for text files (provided via Brightspace)
- `AI-use-log.md` - Document AI assistance

## Required Analyses

1. **Word frequency analysis** - Most common words (excluding stopwords)
2. **TF-IDF** - Distinctive terms across documents
3. **Named Entity Recognition** - Extract people, places, organizations (using spaCy)
4. **Sentiment analysis** - Track emotional tenor over time or across sources

## Deliverables

- Jupyter notebook with complete analysis
- Visualizations of findings
- Written interpretation (500-750 words) of computational results
- Critical reflection on limitations
- AI use log

## Key Questions

- What can distant reading reveal that close reading cannot?
- What are the limitations of these methods for historical interpretation?
- How do you validate computational findings?

## Grading Criteria

- Technical execution (30%)
- Historical interpretation (30%)
- Critical reflection (25%)
- Documentation (15%)
